Final project for the Bachelor Thesis class (CM3051).

  - Collection of movies' metadata is done through OMDb's API and Box Mojo Office.
  - Script for collecting Tweets of each movie is ready. However, I intend to incorporate a function to clean each of the Tweets before exporting them to the table. I expect to finish and run the script early next week. 
  - Script for scraping foreign revenues is also ready.
